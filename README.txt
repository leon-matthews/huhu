What is Huhu?
=============

Huhu is a web server log file parser and analysis tool using Python.

Web server log files are read, and statistics acumulated.  The statistics
gathered are then used to generate reports of various types and formats.

New data can be added to the accumulated statistics at any time to produce
updated reports.
